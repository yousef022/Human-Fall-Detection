# Human-Fall-Detection

## Motivation and Rationale

* The motivation surrounding the development of this Ubicom system:
    * The motivation behind this project stems from a critical need for enhanced safety and rapid response in retirement homes, where residents may face challenges in alerting staff during emergencies, specifically instances of falls.
    * The current reliance on pendants for emergency notification has proven to be insufficient in certain scenarios, leading to delayed response times and, unfortunately, tragic outcomes such as death.
      
* Why we decided to develop this Ubicom system
    * Enhanced Resident Safety
    * Addressing Limitations of Pendent Systems
    * Reducing Healthcare Costs
