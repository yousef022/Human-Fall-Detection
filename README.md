# Human-Fall-Detection


## Motivation and Rationale

* The motivation surrounding the development of this Ubicom system:
    * The motivation behind this project stems from a critical need for enhanced safety and rapid response in retirement homes, where residents may face challenges in alerting staff during emergencies, specifically instances of falls.
    * The current reliance on pendants for emergency notification has proven to be insufficient in certain scenarios, leading to delayed response times and, unfortunately, tragic outcomes such as death.
      
* Why we decided to develop this Ubicom system
    * Enhanced Resident Safety
    * Addressing Limitations of Pendent Systems
    * Reducing Healthcare Costs
      
## Design

* The system works by employing the use of an Android smartphone and its sensors to detect a fall and ping the nearest beacon.
  
* Context (purpose, intended audience, etc.)
   * Meant to simulate a possible scenario in Long-Term care homes.
     
* Algorithms
   * Checks if acceleration is less than or equal to one.
     
* Tools and Libraries used.
   * Flask server
   * Android Sensor SDK
   * Android Studio
## Getting Started
     
### Prerequisites 

* Android smartphone or any custom IoT device with built-in wifi capabilities.
* Any Bluetooth LE beacon(s)
* Any type of computer system (e.g: Laptop, Desktop, Raspberry PI) capable of hosting the Flask server.
